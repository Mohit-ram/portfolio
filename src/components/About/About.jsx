            As a master’s graduate in engineering, I’ve honed my analytical
            skills and technical prowess. But my journey extends beyond the
            classroom. I have also self-taught various domains to enhance my
            programming skills. Experiencing Electronics, web design and 3D
            Animation, I’ve explored diverse areas. However, it was the
            captivating world of AI that truly excited me. Hours spent learning
            courses and earning certificates fueled my passion. ALso, I actively
            produce various AI projects and maintain a blog dedicated to them.
            Now, I seek opportunities within larger corporate teams to flex my
            expertise. Let’s code, solve, and shape the future together! 🚀👩‍💻🌟
