            As a master’s graduate in engineering, I have honed my analytical
            skills and technical expertise. My journey extends beyond formal
            education, as I have self-taught various domains to enhance my
            programming skills. I have explored diverse fields such as
            electronics, web design, and 3D animation, but it is the captivating
            world of AI that truly excited me. I have dedicated countless hours
            to learning courses and earning certificates to gain AI expertise.
            Additionally, I actively produce various AI projects and maintain a
            blog dedicated to them. I am now seeking opportunities within larger
            corporations to be part of a team and further expand my knowledge.
            Let’s code, solve, and shape the future together! 🚀👩‍💻🌟
